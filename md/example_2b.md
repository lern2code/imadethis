These 2 lessons, recording audio, requesting permission on the microphone, deploy javascript code revolving around 2 central API's.
Understand API's and accelerate your software development.
Learn how to use software API's - [a little background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY)

In particular, the "MediaStream API" governs the methods for producing and managing audio and video along with the microphone and or camera.
Among the API's [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API) , you can read more about things like the actual recorder and "ondataavailable" , a software event meaning the mic is ready to turn audio data over to the app. Below, api terms are linked to corresponding lines in the code you have been learning.
