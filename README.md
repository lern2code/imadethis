# imadethis
### root context from diff project - part2imade
this proj setup to install to a subfolder,
making it hard to remote git push to a plain root.
Plain root necessary for SEO on 'lern2code' subdomain so
it consists merely of ./index.html to push to remote,
supplying root that stands above ./imadethis code project.
